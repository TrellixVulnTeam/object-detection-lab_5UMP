# object-detection-lab

A lab for experimenting with object detection. \
This repository is a place for me to store all the resources and code related to object detection so that I can further explore the topic in detail.

## File structure

Each "experiment" that I am working on are placed in each subfolder, with the entire poetry config and virtual environment setup together with the entire "experiment". This ensures that each environment will not be contaminated across different projects and allows plenty of seperation of Python versions and modules, so I will be able to use multiple Python versions which are not compatible with certain modules.

## Notes

I will probably need to use git lfs instead because this repository is biiiiiig
